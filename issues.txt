bugs:
    * error message displays after next song downloading entry log
    * another song can be downloaded! need to check that the song contains the original title
    * still downloading some live versions (not sure how bad it is)
    * sometimes youtube-dl.exe still fails. Need to retry at least one time in this case
    * some albums create an empty file in their name in  the folder

not implemented yet:
    * sending mails on failures
    * upload new songs to the drive (and delete old ones weekly)
